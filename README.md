## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the design of this project I tried to focus on using relative sizing units to ease the process of adding responsiveness. I learned that I do in fact need to practice. A lot.

### Continued development

I hope to continue to develop my css skills to a mastery level. Specifically positioning.
